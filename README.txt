PLEASE READ:

For execution of the emulator, the 'cpu.cpp' file needs to be compiled.

On macOS using terminal use either:

	1)	make cpu -B
		./cpu

or

	2)  g++ cpu.cpp -o emulator
	    ./emulator

to compile and then execute the code.

On other OS platforms use the equivalent commands where necessary.

The DataLogger output will be placed in the working directory of the 
executable file created during the compilation phase. Terminal will 
display the output of the debugging system.
